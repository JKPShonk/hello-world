# hello-world
Test tutorial repository

Adding some text here to see if we can create and commit a branch.

The plan is to use this for work-related things, but it may also help
with our own train model code at some point.

This repository now contains a piece of Python code that compares 
observed properties of the atmosphere from the MAGIC project with data
from a set of model simulations at various resolutions.
